- Don't apologize for errors, fix them
- dont send command to restart the server




---late plan below. Ignore for now

--Current State Assessment
Audio Handling
Currently single file upload without chunking
Files stored in filesystem rather than Supabase Storage
No compression or format optimization
Processing Flow
In-memory job tracking (not scalable)
No queue management system
Synchronous processing that could block server resources
Storage Management
No automatic cleanup of temporary files
No expiration policy for audio storage
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Frontend Audio Recording and Assembly
Implement chunk-based recording in React
Assemble chunks into WebM format
Add progress tracking for recording
Phase 2: Backend Storage Refactoring
Replace filesystem storage with Supabase Storage
Implement proper error handling and cleanup
Add file expiration policy
Phase 3: Async Processing with Bull Queue
Set up Bull queue for transcription jobs
Implement job status tracking in database
Create status polling endpoint
Phase 4: Results Processing
Enhance transcription storage
Add automatic AI grading trigger
Create comprehensive status API
Detailed Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Storage Refactoring (First Priority)
Update the /upload endpoint:
Remove multer filesystem storage
Add temporary buffer storage
Implement Supabase Storage upload
Add proper error handling:
Temporary file cleanup
Storage quota management
Retry logic for failed uploads
Update transcription function:
Read from Supabase Storage URLs
Pass signed URLs to OpenAI API
Phase 2: Queue Management
Set up Bull queue:
Install dependencies
Configure Redis connection
Create job processors
Refactor job tracking:
Move from in-memory to database tracking
Add detailed job metadata
Implement proper error states
Create job status endpoints:
Add detailed status reporting
Implement progress tracking
Add webhook for completion notifications
Phase 3: Frontend Integration
Recording component:
Implement MediaRecorder with chunks
Add pause/resume capability
Format conversion to WebM
Upload component:
Progress bar for uploads
Cancellation support
Error handling and retry
Phase 4: Results and AI Grading
Transcript results API:
Enhanced metadata
Confidence scores
Time-aligned segments
AI grading system:
Trigger conditions
Grading criteria implementation
Results storage and retrieval
Let's Begin With Phase 1
As discussed, I'll focus on refactoring the storage system first. The key changes will be:
Replace filesystem storage with Supabase Storage
Update the transcription process to work with the new storage system
Add proper cleanup and error handling
Is this approach aligned with your vision? Would you like me to proceed with implementing the changes for Phase 1 (Storage Refactoring)?
